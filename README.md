IMP NOTE(about project):-
1.Due to the limitation of time and the free hosting service it was not possible to designe a whole forum and blog systemm(without wordpress), that's why we're taking the use of subreddit, but the original website will contain a custom made forum service.
2.On the services page, if you want to get the service you need to fill a "Gform" again because of the backend limitations.
3. *We have tried "HEROKU" (we were not familiar with it, we were trying it first time) but some of the backend things were not working properly on that and some webpages were not loading properly, hence we end up hosting it on netlify.*
