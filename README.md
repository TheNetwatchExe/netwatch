### Known bugs

 - In "Our services" webpage, text may collaps only on SOME MOBILE
   DEVICES, *not on pc*.
  - On 1080p screens it is advised to view website on 125% zoom. On 768p screens no need to do anything.

### Programming languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Important Note (about project):-

 1. Due to the limitation of time and the free hosting service it was
    not possible to designe a whole forum and blog systemm(without
    wordpress), that's why we're taking the use of subreddit, but the
    original website will contain a custom made forum service.
  2. On the services page, if you want to get the service you need to fill a "Google form".
   3. *We have tried "HEROKU" (we were not familiar with it, we were trying it first time) but some of the backend things were not working properly on that and some webpages were not loading  properly, hence we end up hosting it on netlify.*
